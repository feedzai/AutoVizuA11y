		AutoVizually shortcut guide. AutoVizually lets you navigate between charts and underlying data
		elements using just the keyboard. When focused on a chart, a description regarding the data will
		be provided â€” you might receive a notification indicating that the chart description was
		produced by an AI model. For JAWS and NVDA users, it is recommended to turn Focus mode before
		navigating the data using the arrow keys.
