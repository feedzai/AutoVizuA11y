## Project Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Run `$ npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a new branch for your pull request (PR).

> **Tip:** Keep your `main` branch synchronized with the original repository. To set this up, run:
>
> ```bash
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/feedzai/AutoVizuA11y
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master main
> ```
>
> This ensures that your `main` branch tracks the upstream repository's master branch, facilitating easier updates. Base your pull request branches on this `main` branch.
